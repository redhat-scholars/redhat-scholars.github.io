[#one]
== Kubernetes Operators I

[cols="1,3,2"]  
|===
| *Duration* | *Audience* | *Level*
|1 hour
|Kubernetes application developers
|Intermediate

Deploying simple applications to Kubernetes is easy. Deploying applications that consist of multiple microservices with complex interactions and configurations is not. Keeping those applications running is an entirely different story all together.
This deep dive session introduces the concept of Kubernetes Operators and how they bring domain-specific knowledge about installing and maintaining your application into the cluster. This course will use the Operator SDK to rapidly build and test operators that leverage existing technologies such as Ansible and Helm. +

This deep dive session builds on the fundamentals introduced in part 1 to build more advanced operators. Using the Operator SDK, an operator will be built from the ground up in Go, including fleshing out its custom resource definitions and RBAC permissions. +
