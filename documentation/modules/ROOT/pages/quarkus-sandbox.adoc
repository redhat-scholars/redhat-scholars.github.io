Is your Java app consuming the serverâ€™s whole memory and taking minutes to boot? And then, even more time to redeploy? Get rid of your old Java applications and learn Quarkus, the supersonic, subatomic Java.
This workshop is intended to give you a hands on introduction to using Quarkus for building applications. You run it on your own following the step-by-step guide and using a shared cluster.  

The workshop uses the Developer Sandbox and OpenShift DevSpaces, Dev Spaces is a Cloud Development Environment(CDE), to develop Quarkus apps and deploy them to a Kubernetes cluster (OpenShift)  

In this workshop you learn how Java apps can have small memory footprints and really fast startup times - milliseconds fast. With Quarkus you also get instantaneous save/refresh coding sessions, continous testing and overall developer joy!
